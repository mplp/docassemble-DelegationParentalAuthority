template: other_parent_explanation
subject: |
  Should my children's other parent sign this form?
content: |
  If your children have another legal parent, both parents can sign the DPA but you are not required to have the other parent sign. 
  You can sign a DPA alone even if you have joint legal custody. However, if you have joint legal custody and only one parent signs, there will be some limits on the DPA.

  In this situation, if parents share legal custody and only one signs the DPA, the DPA will only affect that parent’s rights to care and custody of the children. 
  If only one parent signs the DPA, the person you name to care for your children can only make day-to-day decisions about your children. 
  The caregiver would not be able to make decisions that would impact major issues such as changing school, religious training, or non-routine medical decisions.

  Military Service

  - Do you need this form for a military deployment?: military
    datatype: yesnoradio
    label above field: True
---
template: why_ask_military
subject: |
  How is military service related to this form?
content: |
  Some service members use a Delegation of Parental Authority because they are:
  
  * deployed in a foreign country, **or** 
  * getting ready to deploy to a foreign country.

  In most cases, a Delegation of Parental Authority (DPA) can only be in place for 6 months. However, if you are a service member deployed in a foreign country, a DPA can be in place during your entire deployment, plus 31 days after you return.
---
id: dpa duration intro
question: |
  DPA Duration 
subquestion: |
  % if military:
  Although most of the time a DPA can only be in place for 6 months, service members deployed to a foreign country can have a DPA in place as long as they are deployed, and then for 31 days after they return. This is true even if the deployment is longer than 6 months. 

  A DPA only gives the caregiver power while a child’s parents are gone. When a parent is present to make decisions for your child, the caregiver does not have a right to interfere.

  You can always end a DPA even if this form says it will be in place until a later date. You can revoke (or cancel) a DPA by telling the named caregiver that you are ending it. It is a good idea to also end a DPA in writing.
  % else:
  You can choose when this DPA starts and ends. It can only be in place for 6 months, but you can sign another DPA when this one ends, if needed. 

  No matter which dates you choose, a DPA only gives the caregiver power while a child’s parents are gone. When a parent is present to make a decision for your children, the caregiver does not have a right to interfere.

  You can always end a DPA even if this form gives a later date. You can revoke (or cancel) a DPA by telling the named caregiver that you are ending it. It is a good idea to also end a DPA in writing.

  Your answer here will be printed on your form, but you can always end the DPA by telling the caregiver you name that you are ending it. You do not have to put it in writing, but having written proof that you ended the DPA is a good idea.

---
template: adding_children
subject: |
  Do I need to include all my children in this form?
content: |
  Only include children who are under 18. If you have more than one child, you may include all of your children on this form, 
  but you are not required to include all of your children. Some examples of reasons that you may not include all of your children are:

    * You have multiple children, but one child is staying with a relative for a few weeks. You may create a form for only that child.
    * If you have children that will stay with different caretakers, you will need a separate form for each caretaker. For example, if one child will stay with your mother and one child will stay with your friend, you will need two forms. Each form will list one child and one caretaker.

  What should I include?
content: |
  You should provide any **other information** that could help someone take care of your child.

  This might include things like additional instructions on how give your child their medication or help them with a medical device.
  
  Here is an example:

  *My child uses an albuterol inhaler (0.042% strength) to manage his moderate asthma attacks.
  [BR]
  [BR]
  In case of an asthma attack, he should sit or stand straight while using the inhaler. He should inhale for 3-4 seconds
  while pressing the inhaler, hold his breath for 30 seconds, and then exhale slowly.
  [BR]
  [BR]
  If an asthma attack does not improve within 30 minutes, he should be taken to the nearest doctor or emergency room.*
