template: other_parent_explanation
subject: |
  Should my children's other parent sign this form?
content: |
  If your children have another legal parent, both parents can sign the DPA but you are not required to have the other parent sign. 
  You can sign a DPA alone even if you have joint legal custody. However, if you have joint legal custody and only one parent signs, there will be some limits on the DPA.

  In this situation, if parents share legal custody and only one signs the DPA, the DPA will only affect that parent’s rights to care and custody of the children. 
  If only one parent signs the DPA, the person you name to care for your children can only make day-to-day decisions about your children. 
  The caregiver would not be able to make decisions that would impact major issues such as changing school, religious training, or non-routine medical decisions.

  Military Service
subquestion: |
  ${ collapse_template(why_ask_military) }
fields:
  - Do you need this form for a military deployment?: military
    datatype: yesnoradio
    label above field: True
---
template: why_ask_military
subject: |
  How is military service related to this form?
content: |
  Some service members use a Delegation of Parental Authority because they are:
  
  * deployed in a foreign country, **or** 
  * getting ready to deploy to a foreign country.

  In most cases, a Delegation of Parental Authority (DPA) can only be in place for 180 days. However, if you are a service member deployed in a foreign country, a DPA can be in place during your entire deployment, plus 31 days after you return.
---
id: dpa duration intro
question: |
  DPA Duration 
subquestion: |
  % if military:
  Although most of the time a DPA can only be in place for 180 days, service members deployed to a foreign country can have a DPA in place as long as they are deployed, and then for 31 days after they return. This is true even if the deployment is longer than 180 days. 

  A DPA only gives the caregiver power while a child’s parents are gone. When a parent is present to make decisions for your child, the caregiver does not have a right to interfere.

  You can always end a DPA even if this form says it will be in place until a later date. You can revoke (or cancel) a DPA by telling the named caregiver that you are ending it. It is a good idea to also end a DPA in writing.
  % else:
  You can choose when this DPA starts and ends. It can only be in place for 180 days, but you can sign another DPA when this one ends, if needed. 

  No matter which dates you choose, a DPA only gives the caregiver power while a child’s parents are gone. When a parent is present to make a decision for your children, the caregiver does not have a right to interfere.

  You can always end a DPA even if this form gives a later date. You can revoke (or cancel) a DPA by telling the named caregiver that you are ending it. It is a good idea to also end a DPA in writing.

  Please use this tool one time for **each caregiver**.

  [BR]
  [BR]
  If he has coughing or wheezing, he can take two puffs of his inhaler every 4 hours. 
  He should inhale for 3-4 seconds while pressing the top button, hold it for 30 seconds, then exhale.*
